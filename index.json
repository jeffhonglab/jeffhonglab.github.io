Generally, SO problems may be formulated as follows: \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\Theta}\\ \\mathbf{E}[G(\\mathbf{x},\\omega)], \\] where $\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the decision variables, $\\omega$ denotes the randomness in simulation and the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of $\\omega$. We typically assume that $G(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ has no closed-form expression, but it is the output of a stochastic simulation model, and it can be observed by running simulation experiments at $\\mathbf{x}$. The feasible region $\\Theta$ may take different forms, resulting in different types of SO problems, e.g., continuous SO, discrete SO, stochastically constrained SO etc. My co-authors and I have developed a number of algorithms in this area, including discrete SO algorithms such as COMPASS, AHA and GPS, and continuous SO algorithms such as STRONG. Here is the list of publications and preprints that we have in this area, including a recent review paper on surrogate-based simulation optimization. We are currently working on developing software packages and hope to have them online soon.\nRecently, my group’s research interest in SO focuses on developing algorithms that can take advantage of modern computing tools such as parallel computing and tensorization to solve high-dimensional SO problems, and on understanding how dimensionality affects the convergence of SO algorithms.\n","date":1643587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643587200,"objectID":"3d78cd5613003ce6cf85ae9d610c1ba8","permalink":"https://jeffhonglab.github.io/project/simulation-optimization/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/simulation-optimization/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["research topics"],"title":"Simulation Optimization","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Ranking and selection (R\u0026amp;S) often refers to the problem of selecting the best among a group of alternatives, where the best is often (but not always) defined based on the mean performances.

While empirical evidence showed that these models may explain the option prices to certain extend, their performance may be poor when the actual situation deviates from the assumptions. Neural network models are capable of learning the underlying relationship through the data without prior assumptions. However, to avoid over-fitting, these models often require massive amount of data, which are typically not available for option pricing problems. In this paper we propose a new model by integrating neural networks as components to a classical option pricing model, thus significantly increasing the model flexibility while requiring only a reasonable amount of data. We further show that the training of the model, also known as the calibration in the ﬁeld of financial engineering, may be formulated into a simulation optimization problem, and it may be solved in a way that is compatible to the training of neural networks. Preliminary numerical results show that our approach works well.","tags":["Monte Carlo methods in financial engineering","Emerging areas in stochastic simulation"],"title":"Option Pricing By Neural Stochastic Differential Equations: A Simulation-optimization Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shen, H., L.
