Generally, SO problems may be formulated as follows: \\[ \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\in\\Theta}\\ \\mathbf{E}[G(\\mathbf{x},\\omega)], \\] where $\\mathbf{x}$ denotes the decision variables, $\\omega$ denotes the randomness in simulation and the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of $\\omega$. We typically assume that $G(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ has no closed-form expression, but it is the output of a stochastic simulation model, and it can be observed by running simulation experiments at $\\mathbf{x}$. The feasible region $\\Theta$ may take different forms, resulting in different types of SO problems, e.g., continuous SO, discrete SO, stochastically constrained SO etc. My co-authors and I have developed a number of algorithms in this area, including discrete SO algorithms such as COMPASS, AHA and GPS, and continuous SO algorithms such as STRONG. Here is the list of publications and preprints that we have in this area, including a recent review paper on surrogate-based simulation optimization.

Though empirical evidence shows that these models may partially explain the option prices, their performance may be poor when the actual situations deviate from the assumptions. Neural network models are capable of learning the underlying relationship through the data. However, they require massive amount of data to avoid over-fitting, which is typically not available for option pricing problems. Thus, we propose a new model by integrating neural networks to a classical stochastic differential equation pricing model to balance the model flexibility and the data requirement. Besides, some more specific models are also constructed by using neural network as a model calibration method of the classical models. Furthermore, we show that the training of the model can be formulated into a simulation optimization problem and can be solved in a way that is compatible to the training of neural networks as well. Preliminary numerical results show that our approach appears to work better compared with some existing models.
