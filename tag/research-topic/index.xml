      <title>Simulation Optimization</title>

      <description>&lt;DIV align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
Simulation optimization (SO), almost called optimization via simulation, is one of the most important and fast developing areas in stochastic simulation, because simulation models are often built with the goal of optimization. Generally, SO problems may be formulated as follows:
\[
\min_{\mathbf{x}\in\Theta}\ \mathbf{E}[G(\mathbf{x},\omega)],
\]
where $\mathbf{x}$ denotes the decision variables, $\omega$ denotes the randomness in simulation and the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of $\omega$. We typically assume that $G(\cdot,\cdot)$ has no closed-form expression, but it is the output of a stochastic simulation model, and it can be observed by running simulation experiments at $\mathbf{x}$. The feasible region $\Theta$ may take different forms, resulting in different types of SO problems, e.g., continuous SO, discrete SO, stochastically constrained SO etc.
&lt;p&gt;My co-authors and I have developed a number of algorithms in this area, including discrete SO algorithms such as COMPASS, AHA and GPS, and continuous SO algorithms such as STRONG. Here is the list of publications and preprints that we have in this area, including a recent review paper on surrogate-based simulation optimization. We are currently working on developing software packages and hope to have them online soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my group’s research interest in SO focuses on developing algorithms that can take advantage of modern computing tools such as parallel computing and tensorization to solve high-dimensional SO problems, and on understanding how dimensionality affects the convergence of SO algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monte Carlo Methods in Stochastic Programming</title>
      <link>https://jeffhonglab.github.io/project/monte-carlo-methods-in-stochastic-programming/</link>

      <description>&lt;DIV align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many stochastic programming problems involve complicated performance measures, such as probability, quantile and other risk measures, of random functions that generally have no closed-form expressions. Monte Carlo methods are often used to evaluate these performance measures and to optimize the stochastic programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work in this area focuses on non-convex stochastic programs, such as chance-constrained programs, and developed sample-based (or data-based) convex approximation algorithms to solve them. I have also worked on robust simulation problems that may be formulated into stochastic programs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering</title>
      <link>https://jeffhonglab.github.io/project/monte-carlo-methods-in-financial-engineering/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 1970 08:33:35 +0800</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jeffhonglab.github.io/project/monte-carlo-methods-in-financial-engineering/</guid>
      <description>&lt;DIV align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many financial engineering problems involve estimation, sensitivity analysis and optimization of expectations (or other summary statistics) of a complicated stochastic process. They are natural for stochastic simulation to solve. My group’s work in this area primarily focused on two problems, i.e., risk measurement and sensitivity analysis. Here is the list of publications that we have in this area, including a review paper on Monte Carlo methods for value-at-risks and conditional value-at-risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently working on the estimation and sensitivity analysis of systemic risk measures, such as CoVaR and MES. We are also interested in bringing deep learning tools into the field of financial engineering. The following are some examples of our current work in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;DIV align=&#34;justify&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in using analytical tools to solve operations problems from production, logistics, supply chain management, service operations and healthcare operations etc. My research in this area typically uses stochastic models and statistics to obtain interesting managerial insights or to solve complicated decision-making problems. Here is a list of publications and preprints that I have in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my group’s research interests in this area include both data-driven/empirical works with applications to service operations, healthcare operations as well as revenue management.&lt;/p&gt;
